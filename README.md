# We Are Kings

## Objective
Capture your opponent twice, or the first player with no legal moves loses. The player who wins **best 2 out of 3 matches** wins.

---

## Gameplay
There are 3 actions (choose 1):

### 1. King Action
- Move 1 space (orthogonally or diagonally), then move the block cube.  
- Block cube may **not remain on the same space** and must be placed on a **face-up card**.  
- This renders the card temporarily **impassable**.  
- You may **not capture an opponent** with this action.  

### 2. Action Card
- Move or capture according to the **chess piece** indicated on the card you are on.  
- Rotate the action card **90° once used**.  
- This action card is now considered **impassable**.  

### 3. Mushroom Ring
- Move your player token to a **face-up Mushroom ring card**.  
- Once you do, **turn this card over**.

## Action Cards
Action cards are based on **chess mechanics**:

| Piece  | Movement                  | Capture | Notes |
|--------|--------------------------|---------|-------|
| King   | 1 space orthogonally or diagonally | X       | -     |
| Rook   | Any number of spaces orthogonally | X       | -     |
| Bishop | Any number of spaces diagonally   | X       | -     |
| Knight | L-shape: 2 in one direction, 1 perpendicular (e.g., 2 left, 1 up) | *       | Can jump over impassable cards or block cubes |
| Queen  | Any number of spaces orthogonally or diagonally | X       | -     |

Symbols:  
- `X` : Movement  
- `*` : Capture  
- `-` : Jumping

## Impassable Spaces
- After using an action card, **rotate the card you moved from 90°** — it becomes impassable.  
- You **cannot move onto or through impassable cards**.  
- Only **Knights may jump over impassable spaces**.

---

## Capturing
- If you can move onto a card your opponent is on, you may **capture**:  
  1. Flip your opponent's token so that the **bloodied side is face up**.  
  2. Move your opponent's piece to an **adjacent unoccupied card** (orthogonal or diagonal).  
  3. If no adjacent cards are available, they **lose immediately**.  
- Once you capture your opponent **twice**, you win the match.

---

## Blocking
- When moving as a King, you must move the **block cube**.  
- The block cube may **not remain in the same space**.  
- Any card the block cube is on is considered **impassable**.  
- Normal impassable rules apply.

---

## End of Game
- The game ends when a player has **no legal movement options** on their turn or a player has been **captured twice**.  
- The remaining player is the **winner of the match**.
